**Problem**
 
We always find it difficult to settle on a movie to watch, whether in a group setting or alone. The indecisiveness, from what we know, is a universal feeling. Having so many options at the tip of our fingers is too overwhelming. Would it not be nice to have a curated list of movies chosen from thousands? This is possible with our new program : *Letterboxd Lovrs*! This program will help alleviate the stress of choosing the perfect movie for everyone.  
 
**Features Implemented**
 
Prompted with questions to narrow down the search, the user will choose three different types of genres, a range of movie lengths, and then a range of when the movie got released. Through this, our program will run through an algorithm, user’s choice, to curate the best five options for the user to choose from. It will also display which streaming platforms the movies are available on.
 
Given two different algorithm choices, a hashmap function through C++ and then K nearest neighbors through machine learning with python, the user will be able to opt for either of those, and then the chosen algorithm, will run to get the five most relevant movies, according to user input.
 
With a movie library of 100k movies, we have available information of the types of genres, the year the movie was released, and runtime to trickle down the options to get the best suited list of movies for the user.
 
**Code Description**
 
 
**Distribution**
 
            When we initially began the project, we allocated the different aspects of the project throughout the group of us. Actually executing the project, some of the jobs changed. Jonathan Tran ended up completing the hashmap function and implementation by himself and he also contributed to the GUI of our program. Rachel Prempeh amended the dataset to include new columns and add more datapoints to get the dataset to 100,000. She also contributed to the GUI as well as aided with the machine learning kNN program. Anna Grace Lube was assigned the machine learning part, with Rachel Prempeh, as well as completed the report aspect of the project. We all researched and contributed creatively to the assignment, asking and answering questions for how we wanted to execute each part of the assignment, as well as the development of the original idea itself.
