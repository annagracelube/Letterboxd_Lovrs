# Letterboxd Lovrs

Hi all and welcome to our program : *Letterboxd Lovrs*!

We have two different algorithms that we used and we will go into how each one works!!

- [Machine Learning with Python](#machine-learning-algorithm)

- [Hash Maps with C++](#hash-map-algorithm)

### Machine Learning Algorithm

When initially running our program, the computer will print out a list of 19 possible genres that the user, you, can choose from. Inputting the choices with a comma in between them as well as capitalizing the genres will lead to a successful output.

The user will then be prompted to input the desired duration of the movie that they would like to watch which will be in minutes. When that is completed. The last input will be the year that you would want the movie that you watch is released in.

After that, a list of five different movies will be printed out along with ratings for each of them and the year that they were released, giving you curated choices for what movie you would want to watch.

### Hash Map Algorithm

When running our C++ hash maps function, a GUI window will pop up for you to input three different genres. If you need a refresher on the different genres available, clicking the "Genres" button at the bottom of the screen will take you to a new page with a list of the different possible genres to choose from.

There are additional boxes to input desired parameters : length, release year, and rating! After that, it is just the red submit button and then the top choice will appear center box and the other results, along with the top one, will pop up in the "Top Results" box. Along with the movie, the time taken to run the program will also pop up.
